* User should see link for Basic plan on home page.
* User should see link for Pro plan on home page.

Stripe Integration
* Users should have Stripe customer token(id) in the users table.
* Javascript should prevent pro form from submitting, when user fills it out,
and should send card info to Stripe.  Stripe returns with card token(not customer
token).
* Javascript should send user fields and card token to rails app for validation.
Rails app should validate user fields.  Rails app will note whether plan 1 or 2.
* Once validated, Rails should send user info (email, plan id) and card token to
Stripe server and Stripe will create a subscription and send back customer token.
Rails should save customer token and user information to our database.
